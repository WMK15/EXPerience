# EXPerience - a Submission for HackLondon 2024

## Inspiration
People struggle to keep attention of their tasks and habits. There are many apps over the internet, but they're either not user-friendly or not enough to meet your needs. We want to make productivity an experience - not a chore.

## What it does
It is a full-stack web application that has a gamification element of a adorable little corgi, we'll just call it Doggo for now. Doggo requires you to complete tasks and/or habits using a Pomodoro timer to obtain food tokens. These food tokens are used to keep Doggo happy!

## How we built it
We used the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js) stack to build this web application using React-Bootstrap as a UI library. Both the backend and the frontend are run on separate localhosts.

## Challenges we ran into
We struggled to implement authentication, and also run into bugs that we couldn't find any solutions for.

## Installation
- clone the repository to your local machine
- do `npm install` to install concurrently (and nodemon, not necessary)
- then do `npm run build-client` and `npm run build-server`
- After waiting, do `npm run start`
- It SHOULD work
